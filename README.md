#Installation
Firstly make sure that you have a working install of GO before continuing.

Then execute `go get github.com/2IMN00-16/backend`, install with `go install github.com/2IMN00-16/backend`, and run with `$GOPATH/bin/backend`. This starts a (non-ssl) server which listens on `:1337`. 

#Usage
The started server has a few crud resources, which are defined by the [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) definition in `insomnia.json`.
